jqGridFlip is a versatile slideshow system.

Features include:

- configurable dimensions - 1 item at a time, or a grid of any size
- end-to-end or circular navigation
- image preloading (browser caching)
- optional zoom effects on hover
- html template for each item

Requires:

- jQuery. The only jQ functions used in the core are removeClass(), addClass() and html(), so it could easily be refactored to use another common library, or your own methods.

Does not currently include:

- transitions
- ajax loading

Basic usage:

1 - define a grid_type, by specifying
     - DOM element as a container, by ID
     - an array of data to use. Each element is given to the template function on page flip
     - quantity per page
     - various options
